## Example ~/.config/labwc/environment file.
## Uncomment lines starting with one '#' to suit your needs.


## Use the XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT variable to set the keyboard layout. For example
## to start with Swedish keyboard layout set it to 'se'. If you are unsure what
## your country code is, refer to the layout section of:
## /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst
XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT=us
XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT=

# XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=grp:alt_shift_toggle
## Multiple keyboard layouts can be set by comma-separating the country codes.
## If a variant layout is needed, the syntax is layout(variant)
## If multiple layouts are used, specify the toggle-keybind using
## XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS as show below.
## For further details, see xkeyboard-config(7)
# XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=grp:alt_shift_toggle
# XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=grp:shift_caps_toggle
XCURSOR_THEME=Qogir-dark
XCURSOR_SIZE=24

## Set cursor theme and size. Find system icons themes with:
## `find /usr/share/icons/ -type d -name "cursors"`

## Disable hardware cursors. Most users would not want to do this, but if you

## In order for labwc to work out of the box, the environment variable below
## is set to "1" by default to avoid menus with incorrect offset and blank
## windows with Java applications such as JetBrains and Intellij Idea.
## See https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/595
## labwc will not override any already set environment variables, so if you for
## some reason do not want this, then just set it to "0" (not recommended, but
## mentioned here for completeness).
##

# _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=0

##
## This allows xdg-desktop-portal-wlr to function (e.g. for screen-recording).
## It is automatically set to "wlroots" by labwc though, so it is only
## included here for completeness. Again, labwc will not over-write an
## already set environment variable, so if you need it set to something else,
## then uncomment and adjust.
# XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=wlroots

##
## This causes a virtual output to be created automatically whenever there
## are no outputs around. This helps for cases like wayvnc so there is always
## an output available to connect to. The name can be chosen freely but there
## must be no duplicate output names, for this reason using VIRTUAL-x or a
## physical connector name like HDMI-A-1 is not recommended as wlroots may
## want to create outputs with those names later on which would then fail.

## Using an output name that starts with NOOP- has the additional benefit
## that wayvnc will detect it being a virtual output and allow clients to
## resize the output to match the client resolution.
# LABWC_FALLBACK_OUTPUT=NOOP-fallback
